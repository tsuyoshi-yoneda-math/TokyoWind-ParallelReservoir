We predicted <b>wind speed three hours ahead in the Tokyo region. Using online learning with the most recent 1,000 hours of data, the MAE of 2 m/s for predictions based on the filtered data—together with a correlation of 0.83 between the filtered and original data—can be regarded as a fairly robust result.</b>

The following is a comparable result from our study:

Although the data are not from the same location or period, the MAE for the 3-hour-ahead wind speed prediction is still comparable. Our conclusion is that our model can quickly respond to sudden local winds and recent weather patterns compared to long-term learning models, the current accuracy is quite promising.

We employ the excellent Ohkubo-Inubushi method (for the Ridge regression) in the latest version.
